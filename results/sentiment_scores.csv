Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink.

I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different.

It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****",1,540,91,0.18541666666666665,0.9791,0.9996515512466431

We've made sure to expose them to a variety of dry and wet foods since they were very young, and they are usually willing to try new things. That being said, they loved this food and took to it with no problems at all. I mixed it 50/50 with their old food (a mid-range name brand), but I didn't even need to.<br /><br />I compared the ingredients and guaranteed analysis in Premium Edge to our current dry food, Purina One Hairball and also Taste of the Wild which I was considering purchasing as well. I found the ingredients in Premium Edge much better than Purina and, in my opinion, even a smidge better than Taste of the Wild. For example, PE's first 4 ingredients are: Chicken, chicken meal, peas, egg product (also a good source of protein for kitties). ToW's first 4 ingredients are: Chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat. Purina's are: Chicken, corn gluten meal, brewers rice, poultry by-product meal. No comparison there. I'd much rather feed my cats a dry food that at least has some ""real"" chicken in it, although chicken meal isn't as bad as some people think it is -- it's just ground up meat and other bits like bone and tissue (which they would eat in a wild or raw diet anyway!) Then there's the guaranteed analysis to consider. More protein is always better, since cats are obligate carnivores and would not eat carbs if they had their choice. PE wins with 45% protein, followed by Tow at 42% then Purina One with only 34%.<br /><br />And finally price... Price per pound based on Amazon price: Premium Edge 18 lb. bag was $1.46/lb., ToW 15 lb. bag was $2.26/lb., and Purina One was $1.59/lb. for 16 lb. bag. So again, Premium Edge came out on top.

My biggest complaint about the Hormel red pasta sauces is that they are all unfailingly too sweet and have a distracting acidic tang to it. This one, thankfully, doesn't have these issues at all. It is a very nice tasting sauce (a little bland but that's par for the course with this type of meal produced to be enjoyed by many different types of people) that pretty much makes the entire dish. The noodles are noodles. Nothing exceptional, nothing horrible. It's the meatballs where this meal fails. I understand that they are attempting to make a lower calorie meal and applaud their efforts but these turkey meatballs are terrible. They are overly dry and have pretty much no taste. Maybe if the meat was ground up and mixed into the sauce, this wouldn't be an issue but instead they are in fairly large chunks.<br /><br />As a whole though, I would rather eat this meal than many, many others in the Hormel line up. It still has way too much sodium (600mg) but comparing that to some of the other meals (upwards of 1300mg) it's much, much better. If you're looking for something that doesn't have to be refrigerated, is quick and easy to heat up, and is fairly palatable, you really can't go wrong with this one.

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.",0,2210,406,0.09335937500000001,0.8545,0.003746101865544915

The shelled ones taste good, a tiny bit sweeter then the ones with the shell (not much thou). The shelled ones were smaller in size then the ones with shell after shelling (about 30% smaller). Again not a problem. The shelled ones were a bit moister (my one daughter preferred the moistness,not me). Fresh roasted are never that moist. Again this may not be a problem for you. Now, the ones with the shell on in my opinion are better as they taste closer to real roasted fresh chestnuts. The shell ones have the more dry in the mouth texture like fresh (but not exactly). All in all I like the ones with the shell better (closer to the fresh roasted). OH YA the shells come off pretty easy on most, a few are harder but well worth the extra work.

The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I'm taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Creamy:<br /><br />""The roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor. Testers thought this sample was a touch oily, but spread the best...Makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich, but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy, vinegar, and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas, broccoli, or a stir-fry. For a sweet version, mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing. Mix with chile paste with garlic (sambal oelek) or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats.""<br /><br />This is my opinion, too, and while the above review was for the regular Creamy, it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.<br /><br />While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she's starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />I will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter. They have two ASIC points:<br /><br />1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />My rating is based on taste and texture. I'm not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue.",1,2188,391,0.26106666666666667,0.9884,0.9945383667945862

I expected to write a detailed taste review after pulling each of these shots this morning, comparing the flavor profiles and nuances side-by-side.

The Espressivo is so horrible, it's a huge disappointment that shouldn't even exist.

Translation: It's not really espresso.<br /><br />I love the lower price.  I love the biodegradable aspect.  I love that a non-Nespresso pod option exists.  I was so excited about this ECC pod, but I couldn't be more disappointed.

I have since tried to brew it in my Keurig (anothers recommendation that I read on a message string) and found it came out pretty good still. I still give it 4 stars, and I still think it wasn't bad at all, in spite of using it the wrong ways. :-)<br /><br />This is so strong that I could almost make an entire pot of coffee with one bag. I love it. A little goes a long way for me. I also like the tea bag type of brewing. Keeps everything clean and good tasting. This is great for those lazy days when you just want to boil water and have a coffee. If you like your coffee really strong, put one in a mug and you will have one VERY strong cup of coffee. If not, make a small pot and you will also be very pleased. I really didn't know what to expect. I remember trying something similar a long time ago with an instant type of coffee and it was terrible. This is much better than I expected. I also think this offers a good value.

I'm a tea aficionado who has at least two cups every morning. I've sampled Irish teas in Ireland, the best British teas in England, not to mention great American brands like Stash.

The coconut chai is great on a cold morning-- brew it in your cup filled only half-way with water; then add warm milk to fill the cup (I add two teaspoons of raw sugar, but use your own preferred sweetener)-- it will sooth your soul and make any task at work manageable.  It is a moment of zen in a teacup.<br /><br />At first, I found the flavor of the rose tea a little odd, but I've grown to like it and now it's one of my favorites.

So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.) I heartily recommend this oil if you are looking for organic, pure, not hydrogenated coconut oil at a good price, (unless you don't want the coconut taste.)",1,1471,281,0.2027529761904762,0.9718,0.944545328617096

The company spent a great deal of time with me explaining the below and seemed sincere.<br /><br />CHANGE FROM NEW ZEALAND TO US<br /><br />The majority of their customer base was primarily attracted to the naturally occurring 8.0 alkaline water, and had an issue with water being trucked half way around the world.  Most of the customers wanted a similar quality water with less of an environmental impact.  So the company made the business decision to follow this feedback and invested a great deal of effort finding three natural springs in the US that are naturally alkaline.  Water from New Zealand is no long available.<br /><br />The sources and the water quality report from the new US based springs can be found on their site.<br />[...]<br /><br />DISTILLED WATER<br /><br />During this time an unfortunate mishap happened regarding an order of specially requested water by a department store.  This department store requested distilled water.  The bottles were labeled differently, but the cases looked the same and unfortunately some of this water wound up being distributed by mistake.  The company states they will never create another lot of distilled water and while they regret that this water has hit the market in some areas, it is of limited supply and the issue should dissipate.<br /><br />LABELING<br /><br />The original water that was manufactured in New Zealand, says ""New Zealand"" on the label.  It is no longer being produced.  If you are lucky enough to still be in possession of this water, you have a collector's item.<br /><br />The new US based water, from the three naturally alkaline springs says Source: Multi-Spring, bottled for Eternal Beverages, Walnut Creek CA.  This is the water the company is basing its future on.<br /><br />The distilled water that is out in some markets actually says distilled water on the back of the label.  If you are in possession of this water, you have an inferior product.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL OPINION<br /><br />I happen to be in possession of the original New Zealand water, the new US based spring water, as well as several competing brands: Hawaiian Springs and Mountain Valley Springs.<br /><br />Comparing them by taste and smell, my husband and I agree that this is how we would rate the four products.  1.) New Zealand water is the clear winner, it's a shame we no longer have the option to purchase it, 2.) The US based Eternal Water is our second choice, 3.) Hawaiian Springs is a close second to the US based Eternal Water, 4.) Mountain Valley Spring Water.

Each chocolate candy contains a good-sized blueberry swimming in the liquid filling instead of a cherry.<br /><br />I have come to prefer the dark chocolate cherry cordials much more than the milk chocolate ones but these blueberry cordials are only available in milk chocolate so they are definitely very sweet!

Children also like these if you are willing to share but the drips can be messy for the youngest ones.<br /><br />If you have never read about how they get the liquid center into the candy, it is quite interesting.  When they are made, the filling is solid and it becomes liquid over time because of the invertase, an enzyme that changes the sucrose into glucose and fructose.  Bees also use invertase to make honey from nectar.<br /><br />The 5.6 ounce (159 gram) box contains ten candies, each with 60 calories.

It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!""",0,1805,351,0.10288065843621398,0.9502,0.002005146350711584

Still, this flavor and blend of spices is so warm and nice.<br /><br />Reminds me of a snowy day growing up (rare as it was in MD.) and just some really enjoyable and simple times.  This little lavender pack of oatmeal will rank on top of my comfort food list.  Have always loved it and always will.  It's a treat. :)<br /><br />My packs arrived fresh from Amazon and in good shape.  They were not expired (still 1.5 years to go) and I didn't notice any strange flora or fauna in the mix :-/ -- just spicy coated raisins and oats ... and my favorite blends of various cinammons and whatever spices they use to get that great flavor.  I could be speaking from a lot of nostalgia ... but if you've made it to this product and my product review I am thinking you may feel that sense too.<br /><br />Here's what I say ... GO FOR IT! ;)",1,1283,231,0.17763888888888887,0.963,0.9996505975723267

We were feeding Similac Advantage to our baby until the recall and then shifted to this after some trial and error. Similac was our choice only because we were introduced to it at the hospital and as first time parents didn't know any better (and since our baby was mostly on breastmilk until the recall we didn't look around much either), though I liked Similac better than other brands sold in the stores -- I always tasted the formulas, some that I bought after the recall as replacements were just disgusting. This one actually tastes good as normal milk powder does if you ever tasted that, I'm glad I stumbled upon it after getting on the internet and researching the formulas. The baby likes it very much as well and the price is great considering the big size of the can. Plus you don't need to run around the stores to find the one and only that sells it. There is no way I'm shifting back to Similac!",1,944,174,0.2544736842105263,0.9029,0.9918972253799438

I've never been able to swallow green food mixes, other than Green Magma (which is not ""mixed"", but just barley grass). Wheat grass makes me gag. Literally--cannot swallow it. My body rejects it and I gag and spit it out. So, over the years, trying green foods trying to find something I can swallow has been trying.<br /><br />Well, there ya go. This one works.<br /><br />I ordered it on the basis of numerous positive flavor reviews and I liked the list of nutrients/enzymes.<br /><br />30 calories per serving of 8 grams= 1 g fat, 2 g protein, 4 g carbs (2 g fiber), 65% Vit A, 30% of C and K, 15% of B12 and Riboflavin, 6% of iron and manganese; organic grasses (wheat, barley, alfalfa, spirulina, spinach, broccoli, chlorela); with antioxidant from maca, acai, carrot, rose hips, beet, pineapple, green tea, acerola cherry. Fiber from apple pectin, organic oat powder, organic flax seed powder. Also L acidophilus, peppermint, Siberian eleuthero root, and sea salt.<br /><br />The flavor is pleasant. It's like the taste of bitterish dark chocolate bars with a grassy undertone that isn't offputting. It's not like it's a chocolate malted or anything, but it works fine for me. I can drink this. I do not gag. Yay.<br /><br />I will reorder this. I like the healthful profile and the flavor.<br /><br />UPDATE: Okay, I didn't really expect a noticeable effect from this (I mean, I've had superfoods before and didn't suddenly go change the world or anything), but I have actually noticed an uptick in my energy after adding this to my pre-workout smoothie and my pre-chore protein drink. I've been adding it to BSN sytha-6 chocolate protein mix with an extra teaspoon (heaping) of Raw cacao (organic), and it's a nice flavor combo. I think it would be great with a banana, too, for extra potassium (a chocobanana vibe).<br /><br />Maybe it's placebo. Who knows? But as I wasn't thinking I'd notice a change, maybe not.

I really wasn't expecting much from them, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are mild, but good tasting and not sickly sweet.  Similarly, the carbonation turns out to have a pleasant effect rather than the gut-busting feeling you get from drinking soda.  I was also happy to see that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar or aspartame.  The only drawback is the sodium content (contained in the compounds that create the carbonation.)  One other thing to note is that one tablet is for 6 ounces of water, so you will likely need to use 2 or 3 tablets for a ""normal"" glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that if you are a soda drinker, you will find these disappointing since the flavors and carbonation are mild.

It's smooth and just sweet enough to remind me of bittersweet chocolate, more than dark.<br /><br />The reason for 4 and not 5 stars has more to do with the price of being environmentally aware.  Perhaps that explains the price hike on this bar of chocolate versus some others?

Maybe not as much as Scott Roberts (of scottrobertsweb.com) but fairly close. I use hot sauce all the time.  I've tried hundreds of brands.  And this is easily in my top 5 hot sauces ever.  It might even take the #1 spot, if the hotter version of this, made with fresh scorpion peppers (Cauterizer) did not exist.<br /><br />First, it's hot.  It's not so ungodly hot that I can't run a solid line down my burrito, but it's hot enough where even the most hardcore of chileheads can tell it's hot.  It's hot enough to get the job done.  And it's a perfect heat where I can use it with anything.  It is one of the hotter non-extract based sauces out there (which means it should have good flavor -- those who don't know, most extract sauces taste a little chemically and thus lack in flavor).<br /><br />Second, there's flavor which is the most important category.  After all, who wants to eat something that's hot, but doesn't particularly taste good? And flavor is where this sauce excels.  This is a Louisiana style hot sauce with a vinegary base, but the flavor is much more complex than any other Louisiana style hot sauce I have ever had.  While there is a bitter vinegery taste that we have come to associate to Louisiana style hot sauce, there is a sweet fruity flavor at the same time.  It works as a Louisiana style hot sauce, and also with dishes that one normally wouldn't associate with a Louisiana style hot sauce.  In short, this sauce is good with anything which makes it the most versatile hot sauce of its style.<br /><br />Third, they all have some cool artwork on the bottles.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoy spicy foods, you really can't go wrong with this hot sauce or anything Heartbreaking Dawns really.",1,1799,325,0.2269722222222222,0.989,0.9938969016075134

I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but my local Whole Foods market just a couple days ago. Normally I'm not one to do reviews, but since this product is so expensive, I wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />I've been working really hard recently to cut my sugar intake. After reading rave reviews on Amazon about Sweet Tree Coconut Palm sugar, and doing a little research, I debated for 2 weeks, and then decided to just go get some even though it was $5 for a pound. (my health is more important) I started out by using some in my steel cut oats yesterday, which I really liked! I also used it in my coffee yesterday in place of regular sugar, but I noticed little dark things floated to the top. I know it's pretty raw, so I figured, maybe they were little fibers from the tree, or perhaps it was something with that batch of coffee? So I just scooped the little dark floaters out, and drank my coffee. Which tasted pretty good with the palm sugar! I was so pleased, that I was very excited to have my coffee this morning with my new found sweetener.<br /><br />This morning (not more than 10 minutes ago) I made some coffee again with my palm sugar, and before I even had a chance to drink it... more little floaters! As I pushed them to the sides of my white cup, one I noticed for sure had LEGS on it! Yes, my friends... it was a BUG!! I dumped my coffee imediately, and made some more with(unfortunately) my raw organic sugar that I still have. No floaters. So it's definitely not in the coffee... it's in the palm sugar! Has anyone else had an experience/noticed this? I know it's supposed to be healthier and all... but for $5 I'd like my sugar to not have little bugs in it. That's NOT the extra minerals I had in mind! Maybe I just got a bad bag?  It's not my intention to bad mouth this company -- but I would want someone to tell me if they knew I was eating/drinking little bugs.

Also, I'm a vegetarian, so it's hard to find places with a plethora of options, other than the standard avo-cucumber rolls. I decided I wanted to try my hand at making my own sushi, but I was a little nervous about buying the right type of rice, nori, inside ingredients and wasn't sure I wanted to buy a full out kit if I wasn't going to use it very often. I decided this would be a good product that would be that intermediate step - not doing all the work myself, but trying it out nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- You can put whatever you'd like inside (I like sweet potato or banana rolls myself!).<br />- Easy to make! Just pop the rice bowl in the microwave, spread some rice on the nori, throw a couple ingredients inside, and you're good to go.<br />- You don't have to have just one type of sushi! I'd rather have 10 pieces, each with slightly different contents than 8 pieces that are exactly the same. This allows me to do such.<br />- Easy to bring for work, and like an earlier reviewer mentioned, a fun conversation starter at lunch! Just chop up a couple veggies, throw them in a zip-lock and ta-da, lunch!<br /><br />Cons<br />- No wasabi. This isn't a big deal for me, as I like my sushi rolls condiment free, but my partner likes his sushi doused in soy sauce and wasabi. It does come with a little soy sauce packet, but that's it.<br />- It's not so much a ""roll"" as a little packet that you delicately have to put together, then shove in your mouth as quickly as possible to prevent it from falling apart. This may be my own ineptness, but I find it a bit tricky to keep together.<br />- I'm not sure you can make inside out rolls (rice on the outside) with this kit. I don't always love the taste of seaweed, but putting a bit of rice on the outside of my ""packet"" and putting that side in my mouth first works a little.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun lunch.

I also work in the natural products industry at the senior level and have seen the deception first hand.

It has caused my family other serious complications from eyesight to teeth and mouth difficulties and it has to stop. I am writing this reveiw because I am tired of feeling powerless while companies are prospering at the expense of our health. I follow a paleolithic diet for the most part and recently for my birthday decided to have a turkey sandwich on Udi's bagels. Well they are most certainly not gluten free. EVEN IF LESS THAN 5ppm still makes someone sick. My entire mouth broke out in canker sores and I got a white spot on my front tooth that has not gone away because the gluten sensitivity is preventing iron absorption. Udi's is making millions of dollars and people are getting sick even if they are not sensitive enough to feel it. We had the gluten tested at the doctor's and yep sure enough it was UDI's bread that we reacted to.

The gum was most popular at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan,<br />where nearly 4,100 packs were sold. In fact, combat exchanges accounted for eight of the 10 best-selling<br />locations for Jolt Gum; more than 64,000 packs were sold in war zones in one year. That's still a far cry<br />from sales of the preferred combat zone pick-me-up, Red Bull energy drink, which easily moves more<br />than 30,000 cans at contingency exchanges every week!<br /><br />In war the Tiger never goes away:<br />In the combat zones, our enlisted soldiers live in a state of near-constant arousal with high levels of<br />physical, mental and emotional stress.

Ginseng is also an appetite suppressant, a<br />potent natural stimulant, minus the jittery side effects of caffeine, and it enhances<br />memory and cognitive functions.<br /><br />Guarana is a South American Herb that stimulates<br />the brain with slow-release power (but once Guarana kicks in, it works better than caffeine.).<br />Also Guarana doesn't interfere with the sleep process (it actually gives you<br />a better quality sleep over the long haul). Guarana is also non-addictive, relieves stress and<br />anxiety, and increases concentration. Another benefit of Guarana is that it is a diuretic,<br />which can help alleviate fluid retention.<br /><br />Fact: ""Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum"" not only tastes better, it is better for you,<br />and believe me, it beats chewing bitter-tasting freeze-dried coffee!<br />Personal experience:<br />Awesome results for the overnight deadlines rush!<br />Sent from 'on-loan-from-God'-<br />second-hand-awesome Macbook:<br />Excuse brevity, spelling and punctuation:<br />iTyped with my Bi%$#y iThumbs!",1,3148,473,0.10866744366744367,0.9439,0.454349547624588

So far, no staining on her bedding at all.

The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches.
